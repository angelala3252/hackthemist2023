# Why you always in a mood?

# By Angela Zhuo, Dian Rong, Ethan Goetz

Description: 
Our project takes a text and returns its sentiment in the form of a mood ring!

The Red scale measures how passionate the tweet is with dark red representing more passion, green scale measures how rude the tweet is, with dark green representing more rude, and the blue scale measures how sad the tweet is, with dark blue being more sad.
